# EPSYOYScreener
This program checks if the year over year earnings growth and the change in EPS meet certain parameters in order to check for a growth setup, this specific operation is usually done in expensive stock market screener software, but for people who dont need all of the other features making a DIY program such as this is perfect.<br />
I made this program a while back so the data it webscrapes will not be applicable for current day, but the main structure of the program can be used for many different DIY stock market screeners.
If you would like to test out the program (Keeping in mind the program is outdated) you can with the repl.it link below:<br />
